As you can see, detecting whether a string is normalized can be quite efficient. A lot of the cost of normalizing in the “second row” is for the initialization of buffers. The cost of which is amortized when one is processing larger strings.
As it turns out, these buffers are rarely needed, so we may change the implementation at some point to speed up the common case for small strings even further.
